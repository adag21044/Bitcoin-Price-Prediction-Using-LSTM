# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM


This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict the closing price of Bitcoin based on historical data. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, and it leverages a time-series dataset to learn and forecast future prices.

## Features
- Uses LSTM layers to capture sequential patterns in Bitcoin's historical price data.
- Includes techniques such as dropout layers and early stopping to reduce overfitting.
- Visualizes training and testing predictions compared to actual Bitcoin prices.
